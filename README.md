# data-exploration
An exploration with the Toronto COVID-19 up to January 28th, 2020, as well as the Toronto neighborhood data.
The COVID-19 data is retrieved from the OpenData Toronto portal, originated from the Ontario Ministry of Health, Integrated Public Health Information System and CORES. The neighborhood profile data is from the 2016 Census, also from the OpenData Toronto portal.
The aim of this project is to re-construct the graphs from the COVID portal, and construct plots to reflect features like COVID-cases in different neighborhoods and the share of income in different neighborhoods. We use `ggplot` from the `tidyverse` package to accomplish these tasks.
